# nhm-windshaft-utils

This is a collection of utilities and artefacts that have been created during the development of the map
interface to the collection.

It consists of various notes files, demo html pages for different parts of the functionality and also some
tilemill projects for exploring the data. These might provide ideas for other projects.
